##  About Me

Hi, I'm Elias Girma — an IT Specialist transitioning into AI, Data Engineering, and Backend Web Development. I'm dedicated to creating systems that drive positive change, particularly in **health tech** and **education**.

Currently, I'm working on a variety of projects including:

-  **Backend Development** – Creating web applications, APIs, and backend services  
-  **Data Engineering** – Developing data pipelines, models, and analytics tools for informed decision-making

I’m also a learner in the **ProDev Backend Program** at **ALX Academy**.

My journey began with a deep curiosity about how software works and evolved into a passion for building scalable, impactful systems in traditional sectors.
